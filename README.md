# Garage-Project-cs
During my second year in my C# course, I completed a project that incorporated object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design concepts.
The project involved developing a garage manager application, which allowed users to add customers and record detailed information about their vehicles,
including vehicle condition and other relevant data.
