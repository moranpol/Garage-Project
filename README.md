# Garage Project
## About
The Garage Management System is a application designed to track and manage vehicles within a garage, providing real-time status updates.

## Key Features:
1. "Put" a new car into the garage - The user enters the license number of the vehicle they wish to enter the garage.
2. Show the user the list of the license numbers of the vehicles in the garage, with the option to filter by their condition is in the garage.
3. Change the status of a vehicle in the garage.
4. Inflate the car's wheels to the maximum (the user enters a license number).
5. Refuel a vehicle powered by fuel (the user enters a license number, type of fuel to fill, amount to fill).
6. Charge an electric vehicle (the user enters the data is the license number, amount of minutes to charge).
7. Display complete vehicle data by license number.

## Methodology and Design:
The project is structured around a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism for efficient code organization and reuse. Additionally, the system enforces a clear separation between the core logic (backend) and the user interface (UI) for enhanced maintainability and scalability. Furthermore, it is engineered to be highly adaptable, allowing for the seamless integration of new vehicle types through the application of the Factory Design Pattern.
